If he can only perform good or only perform evil,
then he is a clockwork orange—
meaning that he has the appearance of an organism 
lovely with colour and juice but is in fact 
only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil.

The pain and sickness all over me like an animal. 
Then I realized what it was. 
The music coming up from the floor was our old friend, 
Ludwig Van, 
and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.”
